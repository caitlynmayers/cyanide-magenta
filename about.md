### Cyanide

Cyanide’s not something that people associate with positive things. After all, it’s a deadly chemical. You’ll notice around here that I may say some things that are biting or show some work that’s edgy, and that’s part of who I am. I’m a critical and brutally honest person. Admission’s the first step to recovery, right?

Cyanide’s most common use is in mining — it’s used to extract the precious items from the earth, helping to remove the gold and silver trapped in its less valuable casing. It extracts what matters most; what brings the owner the most value for their effort, and I think that a critical and honest perspective helps me do the same with my strategy and design work. Like the cyanide does in mining, critical thinking and honesty helps bring my clients the most value by getting what matters most out of my work.

### and Magenta

Magenta represents everything that’s right with the world — love, light, brightness, warmth,  happiness. Everything’s better with a little splash of magenta thrown in there. I guess the information below is my magenta (beside the actual magenta in my life).

> I am a strategist, designer and front-end developer, and I specialize in building brands with an emphasis in digital media.

Solving problems is one of my favorite things to do. I’ve always enjoyed a good challenge, whether it’s figuring out a better way to do something or figuring out what is logical, and I think that is why I was so drawn to design. I have a BS in Graphic Design with an emphasis in Print, but have chosen to specialize in the web after spending a few years cutting my teeth in the advertising industry. Designing and building for the web require a tremendous amount of problem-solving, strategic thinking, planning and up-front work, and my love of those aspects of design are what drew me in and have kept me here.

> I’m a woman in the tech industry and am especially proud of this fact.

I am currently working at [CO+LAB](https://www.teamcolab.com), a digital experience agency specializing in the web, where I get focus on strategic and design work, with a sprinkling of front-end development in the mix. I strongly believe that we need more women (and other minorities!) in our industry and need more companies to create environments that are woman-friendly. It is equally important for women in tech to volunteer and get involved with organizations that actively encourage young girls to stay interested in STEM, and I am very much looking forward to being involved in mentoring as a part of these programs in early 2016.

> When I’m not working hard for the money at CO+LAB, I’m hanging out with my husband, reading, watching TV and movies, listening to music and podcasts, and working on fun freelance projects.

I’m lucky enough to be married to [Andrew](http://www.twitter.com/jamayers), an iOS developer at [Mobelux](http://www.mobelux.com). They happen to share a workspace in the same building as CO+LAB, and that has spoiled me rotten. We live a geeked-out life together, mostly talking about the latest tech thing that has happened. I am trying to read more and am addicted to true crime novels, and you can keep up with my reading list and sad progress on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3880836-caitlyn-mayers). I’m mostly on [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/user/1246801664?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open) these days and create a few cool playlists and listen to some good music every now and then. 

If you’re interested, you can follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/caitlynmayers) or drop me a line on the [Contact page](/contact.html).

Thanks for stopping by and making it this far. You deserve [a treat](https://twitter.com/AwardsDarwin).
