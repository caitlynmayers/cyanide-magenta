A friend of mine sent me a link to a photo of a tattoo of the photoshop workspace and said that I and two other designer friends should get a tattoo just like it. Don’t get me wrong — this tattoo is pretty cool — but it made me think: If there was one thing I could have tattooed that embodies design, what would it be?

Being a designer isn’t about the software I use, it’s about how I think. The truth is that our technological capabilities shackle our creativity more often than unleashing it. I’ve seen many people struggle to create a concept without being plastered to a screen with a keyboard beneath their hands. Relying on our software to execute has completely stunted our ability to let our minds break free and be revolutionary creatives.

Is there one image that embodies what it means to be a designer? For some, there might be. Me? I don’t think so. Is there one image that conveys what it means to relentlessly pursue an idea, but more importantly, a solution to the problem at hand? Can you depict a process without any limits? Is there a clear way to illustrate forging a unique path? Does one image adequately build this narrative and tell this story?

No, but that’s the beauty of it.
