Foursquare never really clicked with me. I used it for a month or two, but earning badges wasn’t enough of a reward for me to maintain my active use of the service. One major reason for me attempting to utilize the service was to hopefully take advantage of various rewards offered by the venues you check in to. Unfortunately, the venues I frequented didn’t offer rewards.

I think every business should provide some sort of tangible reward for the customers that are frequenters, and therefore, brand ambassadors. Chipotle is one of my favorite restaurants and they have no “frequent flier miles” program. I’d love a free burrito for every 10 burritos I purchase. I’d eat there more often than my addiction requires if I could receive a “Thanks for being a loyal customer!” treat.

I’m the type of person that likes to take short lunch breaks. I like to get in and out of the restaurant with my food in as little time as possible. Chipotle is great for this, IF you time it perfectly. Assuming I arrive somewhere between 11 and 11:15, I can be in and out in under 5 minutes. That’s incredible.

If I’m a frequent eater, why shouldn’t they know my order? More importantly, why shouldn’t they know me? I’d love to see a check-in oriented restaurant that bases the dining experience on you saying “I’m here” and they say “Coming right up”. [The Melt](http://www.sfweekly.com/foodie/2011/06/02/the-melt-meet-jonathan-kaplans-futuristic-grilled-cheese-chain) seems to be pioneering this sort of dining experience with their rapid-fire grilled cheese eatery.

Here’s what I want from Foursquare in the future:

You tell the venue you’re on your way. You specify your order.

You check in. They start your order the minute you arrive.

You find your way to a table. While walking you hit “Pay” in Foursquare’s options. You are then allowed to choose method of payment, all payment data is stored in Foursquare.

Food is ready and brought to you.

This is just for restaurants. Think about how this could change your experience at a concert or at a movie. You could purchase tickets for reserved seats, order food and drinks and pay for it all without having to use more that just your cell phone.

I especially think social banking is the way of the future. With Bank of America tanking… (I guess I should find a new bank) someone needs to step up.

Here’s to hoping Square really takes off.
