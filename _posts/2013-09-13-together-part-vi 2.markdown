Today marks 6 years together with Andrew. To quantify in percentages, that’s 25% of my life with one person. Yes, I know, I’m a spring chicken.

It has been an incredible journey full of love, learning, and certainly an inordinate amount of laughter, which typically results from something I’ve said or done. Life, of course, has ups and downs, and it’s how you deal with the downs that gets you through. Andrew is the most incredible companion and knows that all the downs need are triple chocolate brownies and salted caramel gelato, and we’ll be alright.

Here’s to making it work for 6 years, to surviving (and even enjoying!) working on iOS and web projects together without the need for counseling, and most importantly, to us and the love that’s grown in this last year. Here’s to 60 more.

PS – I’m sorry for contributing to the gray hair.
