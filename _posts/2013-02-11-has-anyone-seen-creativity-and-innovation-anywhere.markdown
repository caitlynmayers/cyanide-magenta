I work in advertising. I think it’s safe to assume that most people don’t think highly of this line of work, but I happen to think that it is one of the best professions one can choose.

I love thinking. It probably sounds strange that someone would enjoy thinking, but I truly love thinking. Brainstorming, concepting, researching and analyzing are all activities that I do around the clock. The ability—no, the requirement—to constantly perform these tasks is what attracted me to advertising. 

The opportunity to create new, fresh, revolutionary ideas is something I look forward to, but I am thoroughly disappointed by what I see in the ad and design worlds today. Logos that closely resemble anything found on [Hipster Branding](http://hipsterbranding.tumblr.com) make me sick. Asinine phrases and taglines in commercials disappoint me. Lazy concepts, typography, etc. make me weep for my profession. 

It seems to me that fellow creatives aren’t doing the work and putting the time in to truly innovate.

Be original.

Be creative.

Be extraordinary.

There is no status quo in our line of work.
