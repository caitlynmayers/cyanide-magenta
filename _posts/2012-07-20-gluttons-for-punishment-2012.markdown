I was driving to work a few days ago and saw a few campaign signs in yards. The idiom “Gluttons for Punishment” popped into my head and I couldn’t shake the thought of a campaign sign or a series of campaign materials featuring this plastered across the paraphernalia.

Election years frustrate me. I tire easily of the relentless bombardment of ads from all parties, but at least President Obama’s designs are pretty to look at. I’m looking at you, every single Republican who has ever run for office, but especially you, [Mittens](http://www.mittromney.com). Trajan? Really? Seriously! Why do all of the Republicans have terrible designs? Check Tim Pawlenty and Rick Santorum just for kicks and giggles. Oh wait. I already know the answer to that question. For once, I’d love to see both the Republican and Democratic candidates with stunning design and well-executed advertising. One can dream, right?

I’d love to turn this into a t-shirt, so keep on the lookout for updates on that in the near future.
