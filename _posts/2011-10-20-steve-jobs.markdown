Every generation has its “Where were you when…” moment. That childhood moment, for me, was 9/11. For those of us who truly understand the greatness of Steve Jobs, his death has become another one of those moments.

But, why?


I was surprised to hear of his death so soon after his resignation was turned in just 6 weeks previous. I knew his health was failing after that resignation — we all did — but I don’t think any of us expected to see him go as soon as he did. After the initial shock, the true emotions of this news began to sink in.

Steve Jobs, a rare and true visionary, was no longer around. In my lifetime, I have witnessed the transitions of society brought about by Steve Jobs through Apple. His contributions extend far beyond the realm of technology ??? he shaped the future. Steve Jobs saw the future and transformed it into the now.

Take a moment to think about the transitions of society you’ve witnessed.

This list is by no means comprehensive.

Every piece of hardware that has dictated how we as consumers send and receive information, content, and media has been revolutionized by Steve Jobs’ vision.

Steve Jobs’ work has had a profound impact on my life. As a lifelong Mac fan, I first experienced the joy of a GUI using a Mac in the early 90s, but I had no idea that I would be spending the rest of my life on a Mac as a graphic designer. The most profound impact Steve Jobs, in conjunction with Jonathan Ive, displayed to the world is simply the fact that form, function, and experience are equals.

I think up until the point Apple began dominating the technology arena, the harmony between form, function, and experience was neither valued nor of import. Function was all that mattered, and the experience of achieving the end result of that function did not matter. Steve changed that, too.

You cannot have a successful product in today’s society if the user experience is not of first and foremost priority when that product is being developed.

Steve did not create this change without an incredibly talented team, many of whom still work for Apple. Some expressed concern when Steve resigned a few weeks ago, but the fact remains that Steve curated a team based on a shared vision and ability to execute that vision, and I maintain my confidence in Apple as a continued innovator in the years to come with Tim Cook at the helm.

Many have shared a renewed inspiration from the words spoken by Steve throughout his life, and the outpouring of love from the world-wide community has been incredibly moving and inspirational.

I think, if Steve were alive to witness how the world has reacted, he would know his job was well done.

Thank you, Steve. The world isn’t the same because of you, and the world will never be the same without you.
