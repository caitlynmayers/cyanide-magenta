We spent the afternoon working on a science fair project with some of our good friends. We built a [Rubens' Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubens%27_tube), which is a simple device that demonstrates how sound waves affect pressure and equalization. We took a pipe and drilled a row of one hundred small holes for the gas to escape through and sealed the ends with balloons. We piped propane gas into the tube and lit the gas, and a beautiful row of tiny flames flickered in front of us.

Most people affix a speaker at one end, but we have a [Rock-it](https://www.origaudio.com/shop/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=29778) speaker from Origaudio, which we found by watching [Shark Tank](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank). This awesome speaker attaches to any surface and resonates on whatever you attach it to. We found that speaker worked better than anything else we tried. 

We played a variety of music and found that most classical music has better variance in pitch and volume, which provided the most variance in flame height. I imagine that being able to better level the sound would produce better sound quality, but it was still a very awesome. We also pinpointed that the F just above middle C produced the tallest flame at 4 inches high. 

For the music nerds out there reading my blog, Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King, Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 Movt. 1, Saint-SÃ¤ens' Symphony No. 3 "Movt. 3", Holst's The Planets Suite - Jupiter, and Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee produced the best results. Coldplay's Viva la Vida was also spectacular. We concluded the evening by roasting marshmallows on the tube. Science is awesome.
