I recently wrote a blog post as a part of continued data analysis for my company, [CO+LAB](https://www.teamcolab.com), that details the data I uncovered about how people are using the websites we build.

I'm a big data nerd, so information like this is always something that interests me, and I thought I'd share it here in case you are as interested in the data as I am.
