Many are complaining about Facebook’s redesign. I am one of those people.

Humans generally do not accept change easily. No one likes change. Up until Google+ entered the Social Networking Field, I agreed with every change Facebook made, both aesthetically and functionally.

Not anymore.

I’m officially angry at Facebook. This recent upgrade does nothing to make me use their website more. In fact, it made it more confusing by further breaking down the functions of the site into separate areas, each area with a different content or communication group that is updated at varying intervals. If we dig a little deeper into Facebook, I think we’ll find the crux of the issue to be something entirely different than aesthetics.

Facebook is now facing a transitional period. Formerly the only alternative to MySpace, Facebook now has Diaspora, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. to compete with. There is a multitude of Social Network platforms that consumers have to choose from. Because of this, people can now choose to use a social network based on features and not users.

I was first annoyed with Facebook when they decided to offer different feed types. I just wanted to see everything my friends posted. I had the time to nurture this addiction by sifting through the hundreds of posts from my 600 friends that were new since I last checked 5 minutes ago. But, Facebook decided to do this for me, and I ended up not getting everything.

I will give Facebook this: by providing the subscribe feature, they are revaluing the word “friend.” You no longer have to friend someone to see their feeds. *applause*

The other social networks offer integration, detailed privacy settings, permission to completely delete info, better security, etc. These details are all things Facebook did wrong initially and then came out with more changes to make Facebookers happy. Let’s be honest, Facebook hasn’t gotten much right on the first try since approximately 2007.

I no longer have control of my news feed on Facebook. I have a second feed that shows me instant updates. Chat is now integrated with messaging. I honestly don’t know how to find anything anymore, and I’ve spent some time looking around.

The biggest issue on the table for Facebook is their lack of examining why people use their site and catering the site to that use. People still use Facebook because:

* They don’t want to switch to another network.
* Their friends are all on Facebook.
* They know how to use it (not anymore).
* It’s the most popular social network.
* To stalk people. (guilty)
* To stay in touch with people.
* Self-esteem boosting.

Ultimately, people use Facebook to communicate with people. Some just to receive communication, some just to send communication. Facebook is making it more and more complicated to accomplish this goal by adding layers of security settings, rearranging the site’s layout, and revamping certain functions.

The fact of the matter is, though, that I can’t leave Facebook yet. I have too many friends on Facebook that aren’t on other networks I use.

But imagine what would happen if everyone was on G+. It’s simple, intuitive, and integrates with the Google Ecosystem. It’s straightforward about its settings and how to change them. Their site is easily usable. Facebook can’t claim that anymore.

I don’t think there will be an immediate and clear “Facebook Killer”. I think the social network that will win the most users will be the network that offers easy integration with other internet services and is easy to understand, use, and make changes to.

Content drives the market now. If you do anything to impede that content’s journey from creator to receiver, you won’t last long in the interwebz.
