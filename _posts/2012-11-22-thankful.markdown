Sometimes it seems that Thanksgiving is the only, and short-lived, day that a majority of people reflect on what they’re thankful for. Which is better than nothing, right?

Today I remember what I’m thankful for: incredible friends, incomparable family, a job I love waking up to do, a husband that loves me more that I deserve and still wants to put up with my craziness, and all the in-between that makes my life comfortable.

Today I am especially humbled and grateful, and I hope this perspective will remain throughout the holiday season and into the years to come.

Happy Thanksgiving to you and yours. I hope you feel as blessed as I do.
