5 years ago today Andrew and I started dating. 5 years might not seem like a lot, but remember, that’s half my life ;) It is strange to think back on that time of our lives and realize how young and näive we were, but how fun it was. I wouldn’t change a single thing from these 5 years, and I look forward to the next 5, 10, 50 years we have ahead. Assuming he lives that long.
