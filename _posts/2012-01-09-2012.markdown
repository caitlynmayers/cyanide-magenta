I am so happy it’s 2012, mostly because it means I don’t have to kern 2011 anymore. Ever.

Looking back over the last year, specifically at the things I blogged about, it was quite an eventful year. This was my first year out of college, in my first home with a mortgage payment I was partially responsible for, and the first year of my career. All in all, it was a great year.
