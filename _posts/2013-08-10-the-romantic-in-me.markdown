I am not the most romantic person, nor am I the warm and fuzzy type. Lately it seems that my relatively hard personality has been slowly chipped away by feelings. All of them.

Last night Andrew fell asleep before me, like he always does. For whatever reason, I don’t like to be touched by anyone or anything when I am trying to sleep. This makes sharing a bed very difficult, and we have a king size mattress to help accommodate this quirk of mine. As we’re laying there – as far apart as possible – he rolls over and touches me and I asked him what he was doing. He simply replied “I was looking for you.”

I don’t know what it was about that comment that melted my heart, but it did. Small moments like this have compounded over the last 6 years and have made this thing called our relationship/marriage so wonderful. It truly is all of the little things that mean so much, and I am so lucky to love this man and know that I am loved just as much in return.
