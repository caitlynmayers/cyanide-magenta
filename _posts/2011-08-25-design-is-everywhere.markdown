I was driving home this afternoon from my delightful Chiropractor when I noticed the stripes on the road that had been freshly painted. The smooth, rich pavement was an excellent surface on which to showcase something I had never before recognized as beautiful road stripes.

The contrast between the ebony pavement and the vibrant yellow was unlike any I had seen previously on the road. The stripes, while the same width apart, were noticeably thinner. For whatever reason, this new stripe size is more elegant than before.

What struck me the most was how pleased I was that something as simple and basic as a road stripe could not only be improved, but that it could also affect me.

Graphic designers, and all artists for that matter, should take this lesson to heart. Beauty is in the Gestalt, but the real magic is in the details. It’s the little, trivial details that make the piece work. These details might be kerning, brush strokes, a perfectly aligned image, how an object feels… whatever it may be, it’s just as important as the piece itself.

Design does matter. Details do matter. People notice them, both consciously and subconsciously (the subconscious aspect is very important). Consistency is everything, and perfection is second-to-none. If you want to have a successful career you will not settle for anything less than absolute perfection.

Here’s the catch… nothing’s ever perfect. The best and worst part of being a graphic designer is the feeling you get once a project is finished. I experience a mix of elation, relief, satisfaction, and the pang of failure. When I reflect on my work I am always tearing it to pieces, saying what I would have done differently and wishing I had done so when I executed the design. The beauty of being a designer, though, is that you are constantly growing and improving. No matter how terrible a piece of my work may be, I always feel better because the work that follows it is better.

If any company or person believes that details matter and executes this vision flawlessly, it would be Apple. Take a look at any product, especially their icon designs — the proof is in the pudding.
