Today is Andrew’s 30th birthday. I’ve struggled with the thought of being married to a 30 year-old more than Andrew has struggled with turning 30, it seems. If someone’s 30th birthday isn’t occasion to post awesomely embarrassing photos of them online, I don’t know what is.

Happy Birthday Andrew – here’s to 30 more. <3
