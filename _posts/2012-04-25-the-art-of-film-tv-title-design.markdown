I’ve always been fascinated with moving picture titles. The earliest recollection I have of being captivated by the titles is from when I was watching some of the earlier Bond movies, which I still love. Of course, after becoming a graphic design student, I quickly learned about the god of titles known to us as Saul Bass. I own a Bass reprint of the Vertigo poster that hangs above my desk in my office and can’t get enough of his work. Bass really is the best of the best when it comes to all things design, but especially title sequences.

Some of my favorite title sequences from recent shows are from the following shows and movies: Fringe, The Pacific (can’t get enough of this one), The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Sherlock Holmes, Lord of War,The Fall, and, of course, Mad Men.

What movie or TV show title sequences have inspired you?
