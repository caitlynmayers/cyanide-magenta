##### Role: Strategist & Designer

When the Richmond Symphony approached CO+LAB about redesigning their website, I couldn't have been more excited about the project. I'm a musician — I began making music as a kid in choirs and eventually worked my way to playing Timpani in my university's Symphony Orchestra and was Principal Percussionist of the university's Wind Symphony as well. The choir I grew up performing in here in Richmond was the Greater Richmond Children's Choir, led by Hope Armstrong Erb. Her father-in-law, the late James Erb, was the choral director of the Richmond Symphony Chorus, and we were lucky enough that whenever a children's choir was needed for one of the orchestral works, we got to perform with them. I have such fond memories of these experiences, and when I was asked to do the design of this project, I was thrilled beyond belief to help translate what the Symphony means to all of us into a new visual language for their website.

A majority of the strategy work had been completed by the time I joined the project, but I was brought in at the tail end of that phase. I was able to help complete a majority of the wireframes for the site, but what was more important was translating the strategic work – the wires, information architecture and template assignments — into a design system. 

I began this process by gathering all of the documentation and outlining patterns of information. One of the benefits of having years of being a musician under my belt was my knowledge of how information should be presented and what types of information would be related and commonly associated with each other, and this made the process of identifying these patterns much smoother.

One example of these types of information is concerts. Concerts are on-the-surface very simple types of information, but as you dig deeper, you realize that there are many smaller pieces of data that comprise one concert. A concert has a date, time and location and a set of (typically) 3 pieces/works. Each concert is usually performed twice, an 8pm concert one day and a 3pm concert the next, typically a Saturday/Sunday pairing. Concerts will often start with the orchestra playing smaller works or specific parts of larger works, with the last piece being an entire symphony. Each concert's music has the piece title, any movements or specific information related to the work that is being played, composer name and any soloist or guest conductor information associated with it.

All of these items are important and have different relevant contexts. One of the goals I achieved through this information pattern work was identifying elements with these commonalities - similar to the concert example above -  and assigning a weight based for each context, which allowed me to determine placement of information across the site, focusing on establishing consistency.
