Every now and again, when I'm browsing Netflix, I decide I'm going to binge all of the documentaries in my queue. During my last binge, I watched the documentary [SOMM](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2204371/), a film that follows four sommeliers through their journey of intense study and rigorous testing in their quest to achieve their Master Sommelier diploma. I was blown away by all of the facets wine - facets I had no idea existed! These experts are required to name a wine, its vintage, region, varietal, etc. after a blind tasting. Their palates and wealth of knowledge blew me away, and I was very excited to learn more about the world of fine wines and spirits with [The Winebow Group](http://www.thewinebowgroup.com).
